# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful way. By bridging the gap between human communication and machine understanding, NLP empowers machines to process text and speech data efficiently, making them capable of interacting with humans naturally.

## How NLP Works

NLP combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to analyze and process human language. The process typically involves:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - **Tokenization**
   - **Stemming/Lemmatization**
   - **Stop Word Removal**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Deployment**

## Applications of NLP

### 1. **Customer Support**

### 2. **Healthcare**

### 3. **Business Analytics**

### 4. **Language Translation**

### 5. **Search Engines**

### 6. **Content Generation**
